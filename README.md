## **Introduction**
**Plex** is an **Animation, VFX and Games pipeline** managing important workflows during production.
Its core is a flexible and independent system for small to mid-sized projects and companies.
The basic idea is to handle the file and folder structure work, setups basic rules and guides the workflow to allow a collaborated working.

> Intuitively guiding the input and output of users to overcome problems and achieve goals.
> Now you have a good game ... or pipeline.

The main idea is to have an overall system which lays the **foundation for the modular scripts** that are plugged into the pipeline and add to its functionality and overall awesomeness.
